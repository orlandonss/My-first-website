Hello, maybe you got here from coincidence, or maybe you are looking further to see my software skills,so i can get a job and work for you and  last, but not least,
propably you just did some random research and then it took you here.
To be clear this is my first group work form university, wich consists in cloning a website without using the source code from de original.
The principal objectives were, learning how to work in group and clone a website.
Me and a Friend from university had to work together, we divided the tasks between us.
I hope you enjoy to see my development during the times.
Gretting from Orlando.
